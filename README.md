# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit the `.env` file and add your Google Cloud API key.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Setting up Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API

1. Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project
2. Enable the Speech-to-Text API for your project in the "APIs & Services" section
3. Create an API key in the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" section
4. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_SPEECH_TO_TEXT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
5. For better security, consider restricting your API key in the Google Cloud Console

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
